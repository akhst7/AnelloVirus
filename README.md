# AnelloVirus
This repo contains a manuscript  with my analysis and perspectives of recent development  of Human Anellovirus, truly remarkable and mysterious  human virus that persistently infects almost entire human population over the entire life span of human,  and with overwhelming viral load, Anellovirus is the most abundant plasma virus in human.  Yet, no known viral pathogenesis or clinical complications associated with this virus has been reported. Certainly, this virus fits right into a definition commensal virus as many experts believe,  however, recent studies have shed light on the dark side of Anellovirus.  My manuscript is about my take on the recent emerging model of ever perplexing enigmatic human Anellovirus.
